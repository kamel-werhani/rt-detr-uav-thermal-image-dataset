## **Introduction**  

YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once version 12) is a state-of-the-art object detection model designed for real-time applications. This project applies YOLOv12 to **thermal UAV imagery** for tasks such as **human detection, vehicle tracking, and anomaly detection** in infrared aerial data.

## **Dataset**  

The dataset consists of **thermal images captured by UAVs**, annotated with bounding boxes. It includes:  
- **Infrared (IR) images** captured in various conditions.  
- **Annotations** in COCO format.  
- **Multiple object classes** (e.g., humans, vehicles, animals).  

ðŸ“Œ **Ensure your dataset is structured as follows:**  
```
/dataset  
    â”œâ”€â”€ Train Set/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/    
    â”œâ”€â”€ Validation Set/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/  
    â”œâ”€â”€ Test Set/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/
```

## **Evaluation**  

Evaluate the trained model on the validation set:  
```bash
python evaluate.py --model weights/best.pt --data dataset/val.json
```

ðŸ“Œ **Metrics reported:**  
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision)**  
- **Precision & Recall**  
- **Inference speed**
